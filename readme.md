Scenario Create a RESTful API for managing a list of tasks. Each task should have the following properties: id, title, description, and completed (a boolean flag indicating whether the task has been completed or not). Requirements You should implement the following endpoints: • GET /tasks: Returns a list of all tasks. • POST /tasks: Adds a new task to the list. The task should be passed in the request body as a JSON object. • GET /tasks/:id: Returns the task with the specified id. • PUT /tasks/:id: Updates the task with the specified id. The updated task should be passed in the request body as a JSON object. • DELETE /tasks/:id: Deletes the task with the specified id. • Adds validation to the endpoints, implements pagination, and uses a middleware for logging requests. • Test your API using Postman or a similar tool.
